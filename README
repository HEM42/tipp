TIPP is an IP Planning application for network departments of
organizations with medium- to large-size networks. While providing all
the necessary functions for keeping track of your IP and network
allocations, it combines the simplicity of design and use with a clean
and thoroughly modern look and feel.

BROWSER COMPATIBILITY
---------------------

Any recent Firefox.  Any recent Opera.
Any recent Safari.  Any recent Chrome.

It sort of works with IE 7.0 and above, but there is a number of kinks
to be sorted out. It definitely will not work at all with previous
versions of IE.

JAVASCRIPT LIBRARIES
--------------------

Please note that various JavaScript libraries are
bundled with this application only for convenience,
